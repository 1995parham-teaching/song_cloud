# Song Cloud ðŸŽ¶

## Introduction

Minimal sound cloud, written by Elahe Dastan just for having fun with SQL-based databases.
Users can have free or premium accounts. They can listen to musics, and we track they playlist.
Musics have categories which are predefined. Users can buy musics or like them.

This project is solely written for demonstration, and it has many performance issues.
